# Next Steps - Full System Testing

## üöÄ Ready to Test the Complete Financial AI App

Our foundation is rock-solid! Here's how to test the full system:

## 1. Start the Full Server

```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd backend

# Start the development server with all features
npm run dev
```

This will start the complete Financial AI App with:
- Authentication endpoints
- Chart of accounts management
- Transaction processing
- AI agent integration
- Customer/vendor management
- Invoice/bill processing
- OCR document processing

## 2. Test Authentication Flow

```bash
# Register a new user and company
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "ceo@testcompany.com",
    "password": "SecurePass123!",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe", 
    "company_name": "Test Company LLC"
  }'

# Login to get JWT token
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "ceo@testcompany.com",
    "password": "SecurePass123!"
  }'
```

## 3. Test Chart of Accounts

```bash
# Get chart of accounts (use JWT token from login)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/v1/accounts/COMPANY_ID/chart

# Create a new account
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/accounts/COMPANY_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "account_category_id": "CATEGORY_ID",
    "code": "1050",
    "name": "Petty Cash",
    "description": "Small cash fund for minor expenses"
  }'
```

## 4. Test AI Agent

```bash
# Analyze a business transaction with AI
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/ai/COMPANY_ID/analyze \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Purchased office supplies from Staples for $156.78",
    "amount": 156.78,
    "date": "2024-01-15"
  }'

# Get AI suggestions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/v1/ai/COMPANY_ID/suggestions
```

## 5. Test OCR Document Processing

```bash
# Upload and analyze a receipt (base64 image)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/documents/COMPANY_ID/upload-analyze \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "image_base64": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQ...",
    "document_type": "receipt",
    "auto_analyze": true
  }'
```

## 6. Test Customer Management

```bash
# Create a customer
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/COMPANY_ID/customers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Acme Corporation",
    "email": "billing@acme.com",
    "billing_address": "123 Business St",
    "payment_terms": "net_30"
  }'

# Get customers
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/v1/COMPANY_ID/customers
```

## 7. Test Transaction Creation

```bash
# Create a journal entry
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/COMPANY_ID/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "transaction_date": "2024-01-15",
    "description": "Office supplies purchase",
    "type": "journal_entry",
    "entries": [
      {
        "account_id": "EXPENSE_ACCOUNT_ID",
        "debit_amount": 156.78,
        "credit_amount": 0,
        "description": "Office supplies expense"
      },
      {
        "account_id": "CASH_ACCOUNT_ID", 
        "debit_amount": 0,
        "credit_amount": 156.78,
        "description": "Cash payment"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## 8. Test Financial Reports

```bash
# Get trial balance
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/v1/COMPANY_ID/trial-balance

# Get general ledger
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/v1/COMPANY_ID/general-ledger

# Get account balance
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/v1/COMPANY_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/balance
```

## 9. Test Invoice Processing

```bash
# Create an invoice
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/COMPANY_ID/invoices \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "CUSTOMER_ID",
    "invoice_date": "2024-01-15",
    "due_date": "2024-02-14",
    "description": "Consulting services",
    "line_items": [
      {
        "description": "Strategy consulting",
        "quantity": 10,
        "unit_price": 150.00
      }
    ],
    "tax_rate": 8.5
  }'
```

## üîß Environment Setup for Full Testing

1. **Set OpenAI API Key** (for AI features):
   ```bash
   # Edit .env file
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Test with Real Data**:
   - Use actual company information
   - Upload real receipt images for OCR testing
   - Create realistic transactions

3. **Monitor Logs**:
   ```bash
   # Watch server logs
   tail -f logs/combined.log
   ```

## üéØ Test Scenarios to Try

### Scenario 1: Complete Sales Cycle
1. Create customer
2. Create and send invoice
3. Record payment received
4. Generate customer aging report

### Scenario 2: Expense Management
1. Upload receipt via OCR
2. Let AI suggest journal entries
3. Approve and implement suggestion
4. Generate expense reports

### Scenario 3: Month-End Closing
1. Review all transactions
2. Run trial balance
3. Generate financial statements
4. Check for AI suggestions

## üö® What to Watch For

‚úÖ **Success Indicators:**
- All API endpoints return 200/201 status codes

- AI suggestions are reasonable and GAAP-compliant
- Financial reports balance correctly

‚ùå **Potential Issues:**
- Missing OpenAI API key (AI features won't work)
- Database connection errors

- Unbalanced journal entries (should be rejected)

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

Expected response times:
- Authentication: < 500ms
- Chart of accounts: < 200ms  
- AI analysis: < 3000ms (due to OpenAI API)
- Database queries: < 100ms
- Report generation: < 1000ms
